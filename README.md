🫀 AI-Based Early Heart Risk Screening and Smart Lipid Monitoring System
📌 Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, often due to late diagnosis and lack of continuous health monitoring. Many individuals avoid regular health checkups because traditional tests are invasive, expensive, and time-consuming. As a result, critical conditions such as high cholesterol, hypertension, and early arterial damage remain undetected until severe complications occur.

This project presents an AI-driven, non-invasive early heart risk screening system that combines computer vision, IoT sensors, machine learning, and automated medical report analysis to identify cardiovascular risks at an early stage and support preventive healthcare.

❗ Problem Statement

Existing healthcare systems rely heavily on invasive tests, manual data entry, and hospital-based diagnosis. There is no easily accessible, intelligent system that continuously screens heart disease risk using non-invasive physiological signals, IoT sensors, and automated medical report analysis.

Due to this limitation, many individuals remain unaware of conditions such as high cholesterol, abnormal heart rate, low oxygen saturation, and hypertension until serious complications occur, leading to heart attacks and strokes.

💡 Proposed Solution

The proposed system is an AI-Based Early Heart Risk Screening and Smart Lipid Monitoring Platform that integrates camera-based analysis, IoT health sensors, and AI models to provide continuous cardiovascular risk assessment.
